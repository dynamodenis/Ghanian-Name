        <p>Everyone can easily tell the year ,month and the day they were born, but most peope can't
            tell the specific day which takes away the excitement of a birthday. But luckily for us in 
            in Ghana they give a name according to the day a child is born, this exciting method is called
            <strong>AKAN NAMES.</strong> 
            How exciting would t be if I had a Ghanian name. Well you don't have to worry cause I can give
            you a legit name. Just fill below and try it......
